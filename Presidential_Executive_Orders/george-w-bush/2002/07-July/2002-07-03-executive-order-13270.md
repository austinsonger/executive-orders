## Executive Order 13270

Executive Order 13270 of July 3, 2002
Tribal Colleges and Universities
### Authority

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
### Section 1.

**Policy**

There is a unique relationship between the United States and Indian tribes, and a special relationship between the United States and Alaska Native entities.

It is the policy of the Federal Government that this Nation's commitment to educational excellence and opportunity must extend as well to the tribal colleges and universities (tribal colleges) that serve Indian tribes and Alaska Native entities.

The President's Board of Advisors on Tribal Colleges and Universities (the “Board”) and the White House Initiative on Tribal Colleges and Universities (WHITCU) established by this order shall ensure that this national policy regarding tribal colleges is carried out with direct accountability at the highest levels of the Federal Government.

Tribal colleges are both integral and essential to their communities.

Often they are the only postsecondary institutions within some of our Nation's poorest rural areas.

They fulfill a vital role: in maintaining and preserving irreplaceable languages and cultural traditions; in offering a high-quality college education to younger students; and in providing job training and other career-building programs to adults and senior citizens.

Tribal colleges provide crucial services in communities that continue to suffer high rates of unemployment and the resulting social and economic distress.

The Federal Government's commitment to tribal colleges is reaffirmed and the private sector can and should contribute to the colleges' educational and cultural missions.

Finally, postsecondary institutions can play a vital role in promoting excellence in early childhood, elementary, and secondary education.

The Federal Government will therefore work to implement the innovations and reforms of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110) in partnership with tribal colleges and their American Indian and Alaska Native communities.
### Section 2.

Definition of Tribal Colleges and Universities
Tribal colleges are those institutions cited in section 532 of the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 (7 U.S.C. 301 note), any other institution that qualifies for funding under the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. 1801 
et seq
.), and Diné College, authorized in the Navajo Community College Assistance Act of 1978, Public Law 95-471, title II (25 U.S.C. 640a note).
### Section 3.

Board of Advisors

(a) Establishment
.

There shall be established in the Department of Education a Presidential advisory committee entitled the President's Board of Advisors on Tribal Colleges and Universities (the “Board”).

(b) Membership
.

The Board shall consist of not more than 15 members who shall be appointed by the President, one of whom shall be designated by the President as Chair.

The Board shall include representatives of tribal colleges and may also include representatives of the higher, early childhood, elementary, and secondary education communities; tribal officials; health, business, and financial institutions; private foundations; and such other persons as the President deems appropriate.

The Board shall provide advice regarding the progress made by Federal agencies toward fulfilling the purposes and objectives of this order.

The Board also shall provide recommendations to the President, through the Secretary of Education (Secretary), on ways the Federal Government can help tribal colleges:

    (2) improve financial management and security, obtain private-sector funding support, and expand and complement Federal education initiatives;

Three-Year Federal Plan

(a) Content
.

Each agency identified by the Secretary shall develop and implement a Three-Year Plan of the agency's efforts to fulfill the purposes of this order.

These Three-Year Plans shall include annual performance indicators and appropriate measurable objectives for the agency.

Among other relevant issues, the plans shall address how the agency intends to increase the capacity of tribal colleges to compete effectively for any available grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and any other Federal resources, and to encourage tribal colleges to participate in Federal programs.

The plans also may emphasize access to high-quality educational opportunities for economically disadvantaged Indian students, consistent with requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001; the preservation and revitalization of tribal languages and cultural traditions; and innovative approaches to better link tribal colleges with early childhood, elementary, and secondary education programs.

The agency's performance indicators and objectives should be clearly reflected in the agency's annual budget submission to the Office of Management and Budget.

To facilitate the attainment of these performance indicators and objectives, the head of each agency identified by the Secretary, shall provide, as appropriate, technical assistance and information to tribal colleges regarding the program activities of the agency 
and the preparation of applications or proposals for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.

(b) Submission

Each agency shall submit its Three-Year Plan to the WHITCU.

In consultation with the Board, the WHITCU shall then review these Three-Year Plans and develop an integrated Three-Year Plan for Assistance to Tribal Colleges, which the Secretary shall review and submit to the President.

Agencies may revise their Three-Year Plans within the three-year period.

(c) Annual Performance Reports.

Each agency shall submit to the WHITCU an Annual Performance Report that measures the agency's performance against the objectives set forth in its Three-Year Plan.

In consultation with the Board, the WHITCU shall review and combine Annual Performance Reports into one annual report, which shall be submitted to the Secretary for review, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget.
### Section 7.
