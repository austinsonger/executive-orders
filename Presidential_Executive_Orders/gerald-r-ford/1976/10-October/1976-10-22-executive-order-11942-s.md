## Executive Order 11942

Ashton C. Barrett, a member of the Federal Maritime Commission, will become subject to mandatory retirement because of age and service as of October 31, 1976, under the provisions of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code, unless exempted by Executive order.

In my judgment, the public interest requires that Ashton C. Barrett be exempted from such mandatory retirement.

NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt Ashton C. Barrett from mandatory retirement until October 31, 1977.

GERALD R. FORD
The White House,
October 22, 1976.
