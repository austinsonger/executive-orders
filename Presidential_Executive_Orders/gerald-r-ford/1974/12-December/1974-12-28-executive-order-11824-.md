## Executive Order 11824

Whitney Gillilland, a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board, during the month of January, 1974, became subject to mandatory retirement for age under the provisions of section 8335 of title 5 of the United States Code unless exempted therefrom by Executive Order. Mr. Gillilland was exempted through December 31, 1974, by Executive Order No. 11756 and has continued to serve on the Civil Aeronautics Board during 1974.

In my judgment, the public interest requires that Mr. Gillilland continue to be exempted from such mandatory retirement.

Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of section 8335 of title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt Whitney Gillilland from mandatory retirement for age until June 30, 1975.

GERALD R. FORD
The White House,
December 28, 1974.
