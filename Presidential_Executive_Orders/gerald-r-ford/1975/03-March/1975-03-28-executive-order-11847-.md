## Executive Order 11847

Walter C. Sauer, First Vice President and Vice Chairman, Export-Import Bank of the United States, will become subject to mandatory retirement for age as of March 31, 1975, under the provisions of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code unless exempted by Executive order.

In my judgment, the public interest requires that Walter C. Sauer be exempted from such mandatory retirement.

Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt Walter C. Sauer from mandatory retirement until March 31, 1976.

GERALD R. FORD
