## Executive Order 11869

Arthur S. Flemming, Commissioner, Administration on Aging, and Chairman, Commission on Civil Rights, will become subject to mandatory retirement for age as of June 30, 1975, under the provisions of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code, unless exempted by Executive order.

In my judgment, the public interest requires that Arthur S. Flemming be exempted from such mandatory retirement.

Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt Arthur S. Flemming from mandatory retirement until June 30, 1976.

GERALD R. FORD
The White House,
June 24, 1975.
