## Executive Order 6303

By virtue of the authority vested in me by the act of June 4, 1897 (ch. 2, 30 Stat. 11, 34, 36), and on the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, the Kaniksu National Forest and the Pend Oreille National Forest, as defined by proclamations of June 8, 1927 (45 Stat. 2911, 2912), are hereby consolidated, and the areas heretofore comprising these national forests shall hereafter be known as the Kaniksu National Forest.

It is further ordered that administration be transferred from the Pend Oreille National Forest to the Coeur d'Alene National Forest, as defined by proclamation of June 29, 1911 (37 Stat. 1698), over all lands lying south and west of the following-described line:
Beginning at a point on the west line of sec. 15, T. 53 N., R. 2 W., Boise meridian, where the hydrographic divide just north of the Barker Creek drainage intersects said section line; thence in an easterly direction along said divide to Bernard Peak; thence in a southerly direction along the hydrographic divide between the West Gold Creek drainage on the east and the Barker and Lewellen Creek drainages on the west to its intersection with the present north boundary of the Coeur d'Alene National Forest.

It is not intended by this order to give any lands a national-forest status which have not heretofore had such status, nor to remove any lands from a national-forest status.
