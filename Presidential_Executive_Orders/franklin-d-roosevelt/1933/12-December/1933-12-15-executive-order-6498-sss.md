## Executive Order 6498

By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 5 of the act of February 8, 1887 (ch. 119, 24 Stat. 388, 389), and by the acts of June 21, 1906 (ch. 3504, 34 Stat. 325, 326), and March 2, 1917 (ch. 146, 39 Stat. 969, 976), it is hereby ordered that the period of trust applying to any Indian lands, whether of a tribal or individual status, upon which the period of trust expires during the calendar year 1934, be, and the same is hereby, extended for a period of 10 years from the date on which any such trust would otherwise expire.

This order is not intended to apply in cases where Congress has specifically reserved to itself authority to extend the period of trust on tribal or individual Indian lands.
