## Executive Order 6475

By virtue of the authority vested in me by the provisions of the last sentence of the eighth paragraph of subdivision second of section 2 of the Civil Service Act of January 16, 1883 (ch. 27, 22 Stat. 403, 404), it is hereby ordered that Miss Anne Stevens may be appointed to a clerical position in the office of the United States attorney at Boston, Massachusetts, without compliance with the requirements of the civil-service rules.

Miss Stevens has been excepted clerk in this office since October 1, 1915, and is, and has been, most efficient in the performance of her duties. Her family is dependent upon her for support.

This order is requested by the United States attorney, and is recommended by the Attorney General.
