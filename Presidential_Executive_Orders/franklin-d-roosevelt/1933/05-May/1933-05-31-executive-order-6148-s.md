## Executive Order 6148

Whereas it is provided by the act of Congress entitled "AN ACT For the relief of unemployment through the performance of useful public work, and for other purposes", approved March 31, 1933 (Public, No. 5, 73d Cong.), that "the President is authorized, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe and by utilizing such existing departments or agencies as he may designate, to provide for employing citizens of the United States who are unemployed, in the construction, maintenance and carrying on of works of a public nature * * * ", and
Whereas the said act also provides as follows: "The President is further authorized, by regulation, to provide for housing the persons so employed and for furnishing them with such subsistence, clothing, medical attendance and hospitalization, and cash allowance, as may be necessary, during the period they are so employed", and
Whereas I am advised by the Secretary of the Navy that, as a result of action taken by the Administrator of the Veterans' Administration under the provisions of the act of Congress approved March 20, 1933 (Public, No. 2, 73d Cong.), naval medical and dental officers are available for furnishing medical and dental attendance to citizens provided with employment by the Director of Emergency Conservation Work, and
