Whereas Sections 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, and 407 of the Act of June 30, 1932, as amended by Section 16 of the Act of March 3, 1933, and Section 1, Title III, Act of March 20, 1933, provide, among other things, that the President may, in order to reduce expenditures to the fullest extent consistent with the efficient operation of the Government, to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable within the revenues, to group, coordinate, and consolidate executive and administrative agencies of the Government as nearly as may be, to reduce the number of such agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, to eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort, abolish the whole or any part of any executive agency and/or the functions thereof;
Now, Therefore, by virtue of the authority so vested in me, and after investigation as provided in said Act as amended having found and hereby declaring that the abolition of the Board of Indian Commissioners created by Section 2039, Revised Statutes (U.S.C., Title 25, Sec. 21), is necessary to accomplish the purposes above set forth, I hereby abolish the said Board and order that its affairs be wound up by the Secretary of the Interior and its records, property, and personnel be transferred and/or remain under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior.

This order shall take effect upon the sixty-first calendar day after its transmission to Congress unless otherwise determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 407 of the Act cited above, as amended as aforesaid.
