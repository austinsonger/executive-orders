## Executive Order 6141

Schedule B of the civil-service rules is hereby amended by the elimination of paragraph 3 of subdivision III reading as follows:
"Special agents employed in collecting cotton statistics."
The effect of this order is to place these positions in the competitive classified service. The present incumbents of the positions will not be accorded a classified status but, if within the required age limits (21 to 60), will be permitted to compete for retention with the general public in examinations which will be announced by the Civil Service Commission under the appropriate provisions of the Civil Service Act and rules.

Because of the intermittent character of the employment, these positions are excluded from the operation of the Retirement Act.

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
The White House,May 23, 1933.
