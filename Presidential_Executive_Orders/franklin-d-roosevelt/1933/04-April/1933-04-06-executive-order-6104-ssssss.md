## Executive Order 6104

Under authority of the act of Congress approved June 4, 1897 (30 Stat. 11, 36; U.S.C., title 16, sec. 473), and on the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, it is hereby ordered that the Cascade National Forest as defined by proclamation of June 7, 1911 (37 Stat. 1684-1685), be consolidated with the Santiam National Forest as defined by proclamation of June 30, 1911 (37 Stat. 1712), and amended by act of February 28, 1925 (43 Stat. 1080). The area hitherto comprising the Cascade and Santiam National Forests shall hereafter be known as the Willamette National Forest.

It is not intended by this order to give any publicly owned lands a national-forest status which have hitherto not had such status, nor to remove any publicly owned lands from a national-forest status.

This order is effective July 1, 1933.
