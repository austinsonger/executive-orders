## Executive Order 6346

A Code of Fair Competition for the Lumber and Timber Products Industries has been heretofore approved by me. After such approval, and in accordance with the provisions of my further Executive order dated July 15, 1933, hearings have been granted by the Administrator to the named applicants, allegedly directly affected by said code, who have claimed that applications thereof have been unjust to them and have applied for an exemption therefrom with reference to the minimum wage provided in the said code.

It appearing to me on the basis of the showing made at the hearings granted the applicants above mentioned as set forth in the report thereon, dated September 15, 1933, rendered to me by the Administrator, which is hereby adopted and approved, that no case of injustice and extreme hardship requiring special treatment has been made out by the above applicants:
Now, therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States, pursuant to the authority and discretion vested in me under title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933, and otherwise, and in accordance with the provisions of my Executive order dated July 15, 1933, providing for hearing on the application of codes under certain circumstances, do order that the application for exemption by the above-named applicants be, and it is hereby, denied.

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
Approval recommended:     Hugh S. Johnson.          Administrator.
