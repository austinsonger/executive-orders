## Executive Order 6167

Section 8, chapter XX, Instructions to Diplomatic Officers, and section 540 of the Consular Regulations of 1896 are hereby canceled and the following established in lieu thereof:
Accounts to be stated in currency of the United States. All accounts of diplomatic and consular officers (except those covering special deposits) must be stated in the currency of the United States; and all drafts on the Secretary of State must be drawn, not in foreign money of account or currency, but in the money of the United States. In all cases when the disbursements are actually made in foreign currency, the vouchers themselves should be taken and rendered to the Comptroller General of the United States in the same currency in which the disbursements are made; satisfactory evidence should accompany the accounts as to the correct valuation of such foreign currency in the coinage of the United States, either in the form of a certificate of a responsible banker or of a diplomatic or consular officer himself based on authentic quotations.
