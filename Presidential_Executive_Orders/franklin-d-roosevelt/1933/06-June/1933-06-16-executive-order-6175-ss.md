## Executive Order 6175

The first sentence of numbered paragraph 2 of Executive Order No. 4240, of June 4, 1925, providing for ratings to determine demotions and separations of departmental employees on account of reduction in force, is rescinded and the following is substituted:
"When preparing lists from which to select employees for demotion or for separation on account of reduction in force, there shall be given a credit for length of service of 2/10 of one point for each full year of Government service for the first five years, 5/10 of one point for each of the next two years, and 1 point for each year thereafter, except that the maximum credit for length of service shall not exceed 10 points: Provided, That whenever retirement after 30 years of service is authorized by law, employees eligible for retirement shall be given no credit for length of service."
The third sentence of the same paragraph is rescinded and the following is substituted:
"For example, an employee with 10 years of service, whose efficiency rating was 70, would receive a demotion or separation rating of 75, while one with 15 years or more of service and a rating of 70 would receive a demotion or separation rating of 80."
