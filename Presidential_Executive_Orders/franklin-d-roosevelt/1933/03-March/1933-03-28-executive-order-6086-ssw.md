New Mexico Principal Meridian
(The survey of the following-described tract was executed by the Bureau of Biological Survey, Department of Agriculture, from April to June 1931. All bearings in the description were turned from the true meridian as determined by altitude observations on the sun during the progress of the survey, and all distances arc expressed in chains. The mean magnetic declination was found to be 13°00' E.)
