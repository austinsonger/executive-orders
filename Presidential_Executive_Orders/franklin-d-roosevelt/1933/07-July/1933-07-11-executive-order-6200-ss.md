Under the direction of the President the Director of the Emergency Conservation Work shall have full authority and power to do or cause to be done all things necessary in connection with the operation of the Emergency Conservation Work in carrying out the provisions of the Act of March 31, 1933, and Executive Orders and instructions issued under the authority contained in that Act. Hereafter no obligation will be incurred for the purchase of supplies, materials, or equipment, the cost of which will exceed $2,500, without the prior approval of the Director of Emergency Conservation Work or the official designated by him for that purpose, and no disbursing officer shall be held liable for any payment made under the provisions of the foregoing Act and said Executive Orders, or for the uncollected balance of any overpayment involved.
    (2) Welfare of Enrolled Men. The Director of the Emergency Conservation Work, under the direction of the President, shall cause to be procured from the Emergency Conservation Fund and furnish such services; athletic and other supplies, equipment, radios, suitable books for traveling libraries on forestry and other subjects, properly balanced between fiction and nonfiction; newspapers and periodicals; and miscellaneous items as may be necessary for the instruction, recreation, amusement and welfare of the enrolled members of the Emergency Conservation Work.
