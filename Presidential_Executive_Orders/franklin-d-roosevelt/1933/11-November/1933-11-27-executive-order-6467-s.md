## Executive Order 6467

A Code of Fair Competition for the Retail Trade was approved by me October 21, 1933. Upon application by parties affected, and it appearing to me that justice requires a postponement of the effective date of article IX, section 4 of said code, in order to allow manufacturers of coupons and other forms of scrip the opportunity to adjust their business and in order to avoid a reduction of employment among such manufacturers, and pursuant to the authority vested in me by title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933, and otherwise, it is hereby ordered that the effective date of article IX, section 4, be extended to July 1, 1934, this order to become effective within 10 days of the date hereof unless cause to the contrary shall have been shown to the Administrator before that date.

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
Approval recommended:     Hugh S. Johnson.          Administrator for 

Industrial Recovery.
