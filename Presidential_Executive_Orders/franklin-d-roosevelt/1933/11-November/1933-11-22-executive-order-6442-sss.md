    (4) Such State emergency relief administration shall appoint such personnel, volunteer or paid, as is required and shall fix the salary of all paid workers subject to the approval of the Federal Emergency Relief Administrator, provided that no salary shall be paid in excess of the amount fixed in section 3(b) of said act.
    (5) Such State emergency relief administration shall appoint such local emergency relief administrations, organizations, or directors as may be necessary.
