## Executive Order 6463

Executive orders issued by me November 6, 1933, and November 13, 1933, terminate on November 20, 1933, the stay now in effect of the provisions limiting machine hours in the Code of Fair Competition for the Cotton Textile Industry, insofar as such provisions apply to the production of tire yarns or fabrics for rubber tires. Upon application by parties affected further hearings have been set for November 27, 1933, upon the issues raised with respect to such provisions. Pursuant to the authority vested in me by title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933, and otherwise, the above-mentioned Executive orders are hereby modified by extending the termination date of said stay until the completion of said hearings and determination by me of the issues raised with respect to the above provisions.
