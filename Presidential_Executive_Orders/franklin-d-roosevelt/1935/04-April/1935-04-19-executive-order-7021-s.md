## Executive Order 7021

Whereas piers, docks, and wharves forming a part of the terminal facilities of the Panama Canal, nineteen of which are suitable for ocean-going vessels (eleven being cargo docks and piers and eight special-purpose docks and piers) were constructed in part from funds of the Panama Railroad Company and in part from appropriations made by the Congress; and
Whereas confusion has arisen in respect to the cargo docks and piers by reason of the fact that the control at both harbor terminals is divided between the Panama Canal and the Panama Railroad Company; and
Whereas it appears desirable, without in any way transferring the ownership of the property involved, to consolidate and coordinate like operations under unified operating control; and
Whereas the consolidation and coordination of all docks and piers used for general cargo purposes under the exclusive control and management of the Panama Railroad Company will afford a more simple and efficient method of operation;
Now, Therefore, by virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me as President of the United States, the Governor of the Panama Canal is hereby authorized to contract with the Panama Railroad Company for the operation by that Company of Piers Nos. 6 and 16 at the Atlantic Terminal, and Piers Nos. 6, 7, 16, 18, and one-half of Pier No. 15 at the Pacific Terminal of the Panama Canal (all of which are owned by the Panama Canal), such operation to be carried on with funds of that Company and upon such terms and conditions as the Governor of the Panama Canal may deem equitable to both the Panama Canal and the Panama Railroad Company.
