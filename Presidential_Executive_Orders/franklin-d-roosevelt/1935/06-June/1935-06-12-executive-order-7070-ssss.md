## Executive Order 7070

By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me as President of the United States, I hereby prescribe the following regulations governing appointments of employees paid from emergency funds:
1. All appointments and reappointments made by the several executive departments, independent establishments, and emergency agencies, the salaries in connection with which are paid from emergency funds as distinguished from the appropriations for the regular activities of the Government, shall be made and specifically designated as either temporary or emergency appointments, and in the case of emergency appointments shall be expressly limited as to the duration thereof to a period not extending beyond the expiration of the emergency appropriation from which such salaries are paid, and in no event beyond June 30, 1937.
2. No officer or representative of any department or agency shall contact or negotiate with an employee of another department or agency with a view to effecting the transfer of such employee until permission for such contact or negotiation has been given by the head of the department or agency in which such employee is employed.
3. If such transfer is approved, the salary of the employee transferred to a position the salary of which is paid from emergency funds shall not be increased at the time of the transfer except upon the approval of the President, and thereafter no increase shall be made in the salary of such employee paid from emergency funds for a period of at least six months.
4. All cases requiring the approval of the President under the terms of this order shall be submitted to the President through the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, together with a detailed statement in each case of the reasons why it is believed the requested increase is justified.
