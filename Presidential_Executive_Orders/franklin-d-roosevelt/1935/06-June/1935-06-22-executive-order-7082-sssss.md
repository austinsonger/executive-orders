By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by the act of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat. 11, 36; title 16, U.S.C., sec. 473), and upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, it is ordered that lands within the Blackfeet National Forest in the State of Montana be, and they are hereby, transferred to the Kootenai and Flathead National forests as follows:

Beginning at a point on the south line of sec.. 9, T. 28 N., R. 25 W., Montana meridian, where the hydrographic divide between the Griffin Creek drainage on the northeast and the Pleasant Valley Creek drainage on the south-west intersects said line; thence in a general northerly direction along the hydrographic divide between the Griffin Creek, Sheppard Creek, Good Creek, Martin Creek, and Le Beau Creek drainages on the east and the Pleasant Valley Creek, Wolf Creek, Fortine Creek, and Sunday Creek drainages on the west, passing over Grubb Mountain, Sanders Mountain, Mount Conner, Elk Mountain, and Ketowka Mountain, to an intersection with the south line of sec. 17, T. 33 N., R. 24 W., Montana meridian; thence easterly along the south line of secs. 16 and 17 to the southeast corner of sec. 16, T. 33 N., R. 24 N., Montana meridian; thence north along the east line of said sec. 16 to an intersection with the present forest boundary; thence following the present forest boundary in a northwesterly, northerly, and northeasterly direction to an intersection with the crest of the Whitefish Range on the north line of sec. 22, T. 35 N., R. 24 W, Montana meridian; thence northerly along the crest of the Whitefish Range, which is the county line between Lincoln and Flathead Counties, Montana, passing over Mount Locke and Bald Mountain, to an intersection with the international boundary between the United States and Canada at boundary monument no. 256.

FROM THE BLACKFEET TO THE FLATHEAD NATIONAL FOREST
All lands within the Blackfeet National Forest lying in Tps. 25 N., Rs. 21 and 22 W.; secs. 26 N., Rs. 21, 22, and 23 W; secs. 27 N., Rs. 21, 22, 23, and 24 W; the south two-thirds of tps. 26 N., Ra. 23, 24, and 25 W., All Montana meridian; and in addition all lands lying to the eastward of the above described line relating to transfers from the Blackfeet to the Kootenai National forest, except the following-described tracts which are hereby eliminated from the Blackfeet National Forest:
T. 33 N., R. 22 W., Montana meridian, SW ¼ sec. 29, S ½ sec. 30, sec. 31, W ½ sec. 32; T. 33 N., R. 23W., Montana meridian, SE ¼ sec. 20, SW ¼ sec. 21, secs. 25 to 36, inclusive; T. 33 N., R. 24 W., Montana meridian, tracts a, b, and c of secs. 24; N ½ NE ¼ NW ¼ NE ¼, N ½ NE ¼ NE ¼, N ½ NE¼ NE ¼ NE ¼, and the NE ¼ SW ¼ NE¼ NE ¼, sec. 25, all sec. 26.
