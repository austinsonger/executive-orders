Now, Therefore, pursuant to the provisions of section 22 of the said order, I hereby order that, except as hereinafter provided, the transfers, consolidations, and eliminations contemplated by section 4 of Executive Order No. 6166, of June 10, 1933, as amended, which are not effected prior to June 30, 1935, pursuant to Executive Order No. 6224, of July 27, 1933, Executive Order No. 6540, of December 28, 1933, Executive Order No. 6727, of May 29, 1934, and Executive Order No. 6927, of December 21, 1934, together with the operation of all other provisions of Executive Order No. 6166, of June 10, 1933, as amended, insofar as they relate to said section 4, be further delayed until December 31, 1935: Provided, That any transfer, consolidation, or elimination, in whole or in part, under said section 4, including any other provisions of the said order of June 10, 1933, insofar as they relate to section 4 thereof, may be made operative and effective between June 30, 1935, and December 31, 1935, by order of the Secretary of the Treasury, approved by the President.
