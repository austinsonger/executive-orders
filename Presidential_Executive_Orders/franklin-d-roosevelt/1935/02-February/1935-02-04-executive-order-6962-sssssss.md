By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 5 of the act of February 8, 1887 (ch. 119, 24 Stat. 388, 389), and the act of June 21, 1906 (ch. 3504, 34 Stat. 325, 326), it is ordered that the periods of trust on allotments made to Indians of the Colville Reservation, Washington, which, unless extended, would expire during the calendar year 1935, be, and they are hereby, extended for a further period of 10 years from the date on which any such trust would otherwise expire; Provided, however, That extensions of the trust periods herein provided for are made subject to the provisions of the act of June 18, 1934 (ch. 576, 48 Stat. 984), and if a majority of the adult Indians of said reservation voting at the election to be held under section 18 of said act shall vote in favor of the application of the provisions of the act to the reservation, then this order shall thereafter cease to be of force and effect.
