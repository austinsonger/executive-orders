## Executive Order 7052

By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by the provisions of paragraph Eighth of subdivision SECOND of section 2 of the Civil Service Act of January 16, 1883 (ch. 27, 22 Stat. 403, 404), it is hereby ordered that the time limit specified by civil-service rule IX may be waived to permit the reinstatement of Mrs. May A. Dunn to a suitable position in the General Accounting Office. Mrs. Dunn, under her maiden name of May Alley, was a classified employee of the Treasury Department from May 1, 1918, to November 30, 1920, when she resigned to be married. The death of her husband, an auditor in the General Accounting Office, on August 26, 1934, alter nearly 32 years in the Government service, left her without adequate means of support for herself and minor child.

This order is issued on the recommendation of the Comptroller General.

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
The White House,May 21, 1935.
