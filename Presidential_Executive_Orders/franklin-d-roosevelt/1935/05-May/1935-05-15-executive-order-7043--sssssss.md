## Executive Order 7043

By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by the provisions of paragraph Eighth of subdivision SECOND of section 2 of the Civil Service Act of January 16, 1883 (ch. 27, 22 Stat. 403, 404), it is hereby ordered that the time limit specified by civil-service rule IX may be waived to permit the reinstatement of Mrs. Fern A. Black to a clerical position in the Los Angeles post office. Mrs. Black, under her maiden name of Fern Fitch, was a classified employee of the Post Office Department in the Los Angeles post office from July 11, 1918, to March 31, 1920, when she resigned to be married. The death of her husband, an employee of the Los Angeles post office, on December 1, 1933, after nearly 28 years in the Government service, left her without adequate means of continued support for herself and two minor children.
