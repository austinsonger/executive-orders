Beginning at monument no. 1 of Round Top Military Reservation, which is a concrete post with a brass plate set in top, from which the true azimuth (measured clockwise from true south) and distance to U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey triangulation station "Ualakaa" is 41°33'30", 99.90 ft., as shown on Government Survey Registered Map 2338; thence from said initial point by true azimuths and distances as follows:
