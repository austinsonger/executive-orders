## Executive Order 6872

By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by the provisions of the last sentence of the eighth paragraph of subdivision second of section 2 of the Civil Service Act of January 16, 1883 (ch. 27, 22 Stat. 403, 404), it is hereby ordered that George S. Ridner may be appointed in the Treasury Department to a position as investigator, Alcohol Tax Unit, Bureau of Internal Revenue, without compliance with the requirements of the civil-service rules.

Mr. Ridner was formerly employed in the Treasury Department in the enforcement of prohibition laws and was removed from the service as a result of conviction on charges of extortion. These charges were reinvestigated and the conclusion reached by officials of the Treasury Department, the judge before whom the case was tried, the prosecuting attorney, and officials of the Department of Justice, that Mr. Ridner had been unjustly and wrongfully convicted. He was granted a full and unconditional pardon on January 12, 1924. In view of Mr. Ridner's previous experience, he will be assigned to investigative duties in connection with violations of internal-revenue laws relating to liquor.

This order is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury.

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
The White House,October 12, 1934.
