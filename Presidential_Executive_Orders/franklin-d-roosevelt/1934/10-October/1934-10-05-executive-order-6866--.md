## Executive Order 6866

By virtue of the authority vested in me by the provisions of the last sentence of the eighth paragraph of subdivision second of section 2 of the Civil Service Act of January 16, 1883 (ch. 27, 22 Stat. 403, 404), paragraph (a) of section 1 of civil-service rule VII, governing certification, is amended by eliminating the final sentence, "Certifications shall be made without regard to sex unless the nature of the duties of the position to be filled are such as, in the opinion of the Commission, can be performed only by men or women, as the case may be," and substituting therefor the sentence, "Certifications shall be made without regard to sex unless sex is specified in the request".
