## Executive Order 6680

Whereas section 16 of the act of March 3, 1933 (ch. 212, 47 Stat. 1517), provides for reorganizations within the executive branch of the Government, requires the President to investigate and determine what reorganizations are necessary to accomplish the purposes therein stated, and authorizes the President to make such reorganizations by Executive order; and
Whereas after investigation I find and declare that the abolishment of the United States Geographic Board and the transfer of its functions to the Department of the Interior would be in the public interest and would effectuate the purposes of said section 16;
Now, Therefore, by virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by the aforesaid section 16 of the act of March 3, 1933, it is ordered that the United States Geographic Board be, and it is hereby, abolished; and it is further ordered that all of the functions of said Board, together with its chairman, secretary, and clerk-stenographer, records, supplies, equipment, and property of every kind, and unexpended balances of appropriations, be, and they are hereby, transferred to the Department of the Interior to be administered under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior.

This order will become effective in accordance with the provisions of section 1 of title III of the act of March 20, 1933 (ch. 3, 48 Stat. 16): Provided, That in case it shall appear to the President that the interests of economy require that the transfer be delayed beyond the date this order becomes effective, he may, in his discretion, fix a later date therefor, and he may for like cause further defer such date from time to time.
