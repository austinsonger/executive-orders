## Executive Order 6684

An application having been duly made, pursuant to and in full compliance with the provisions of Title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933, for my approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Household Goods Storage & Moving Trade, and hearings having been held thereon, and the Administrator having rendered his report containing an analysis of the said Code of Fair Competition, together with his recommendations and findings with respect thereto, and the Administrator having found that the said Code of Fair Competition complies in all respects with the pertinent provisions of Title I of said Act, and that the requirements of clauses (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of Section 3 of said Act have been met:
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States, pursuant to the authority vested in me by Title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933, and otherwise, do approve the report and recommendations and adopt the findings of the Administrator and do order that the said Code of Fair Competition be and it is hereby approved; provided, however, that the provisions of Article VII, Section 1, insofar as they prescribe a waiting period between the filing with the Administrative Boards and the effective date of revised price lists or revised terms and conditions of sale be and they are hereby stayed pending further order by the Administrator either within a period of sixty (60) days from the effective date of this Code or after the completion of a study of open price associations now being conducted by the National Recovery Administration; and provided further it is understood that Article II, Section 1, taken in conjunction with Article II, Section 1 of the Code of Fair Competition for the Trucking Industry, is interpreted to mean that the question to be considered at the public hearing to be held prior to June 15, 1934, is whether or not vehicles engaged in the transportation of used household goods or used office furniture and equipment are to be included wholly or partly in the Code of Fair Competition for the Trucking Industry or wholly or partly under this Code; and provided further that the provisions of Article II, Section 1(c) shall be stayed pending the public hearing to be held prior to June 15, 1934, and pending my further order.
