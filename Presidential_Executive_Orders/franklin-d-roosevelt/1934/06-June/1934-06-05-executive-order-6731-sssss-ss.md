## Executive Order 6731

Whereas it appears that the interests of economy require that the transfer of civil-service retirement functions from the Veterans' Administration to the Civil Service Commission provided for by Executive Order No. 6670, of April 7, 1934, be delayed beyond the effective date of the said order;
Now, Therefore, pursuant to the provisions of the last paragraph of the said order, I hereby order that the transfer provided for by Executive Order No. 6670, of April 7, 1934, be delayed until October 1, 1934: Provided, That such transfer may be made operative and effective between June 7, 1934, and October 1, 1934, by order of the United States Civil Service Commission, approved by the President.
