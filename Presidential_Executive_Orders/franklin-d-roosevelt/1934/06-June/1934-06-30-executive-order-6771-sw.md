## Executive Order 6771

Whereas by virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me under the provisions of title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act of June 16, 1933 (ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195), and in order to effectuate the purposes of said title, I established by Executive Order of March 7, 1934, an organization to be known as the National Recovery Review Board and appointed six members thereof; and
Whereas said Board has made three reports to the President in the exercise of its duties and functions and has substantially completed the work for which it was established; and
Whereas the chairman and two others members of the Board have resigned and any further investigations and reports would not be representative of the Board as originally constituted, or serve to effectuate the purposes for which it was created:
Now, Therefore, the remaining members of the said Board are hereby directed to take the necessary steps to discontinue the said Board prior to July 1, 1934, and it is hereby ordered that the said Board shall cease to exist on that date.

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
The White House,June 30, 1934.
