Whereas, the Federal Alcohol Control Administration has submitted for my approval, certain Amendments to the Code of Fair Competition for the Brewing Industry, and has rendered its report and recommendations and findings thereon:
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States, pursuant to the authority vested in me by Title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933, and otherwise, do hereby find:

2. That due notice and opportunity for hearing to interested parties have been given pursuant to the provisions of the Act and regulations thereunder; and
3. That hearings have been held upon the Amendments pursuant to such notice and the provisions of the Act and regulations thereunder; and
4. That said Code of Fair Competition as amended will constitute a Code of Fair Competition as contemplated by the Act and complies in all respects with pertinent provisions of the Act, including Section 3 (a) of Title I thereof; and
