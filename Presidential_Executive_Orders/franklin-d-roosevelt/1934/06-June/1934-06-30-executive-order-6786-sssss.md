CALIFORNIA
By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by the act of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat. 11, 36, 16 U.S.C., sec. 473), and upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, it is ordered that all lands of the Klamath National Forest as defined by proclamation of June 30, 1911 (37 Stat. 1707), lying to the east of the range line between townships 4 and 5 west, beginning at the northwest corner of township 43 north, range 4 west, Mount Diablo meridian, be, and they are hereby, transferred to and made a part of the Shasta National Forest, California, as defined by proclamation of December 16, 1910 (36 Stat. 2766), as subsequently modified.

It is not intended by this order to give any publicly owned lands a national-forest status which have hitherto not had such status or to remove any publicly owned lands from a national-forest status.

This order shall become effective July 1, 1934.
