## Executive Order 6756

By virtue of authority vested in me under Title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States, do hereby offer to enter into an agreement with the members of such service trades not heretofore codified as shall hereafter be designated by the Administrator for Industrial Recovery, whereunder any such member displaying appropriate NRA insignia shall evidence his agreement to comply with the standards of labor approved by the Administrator, on the condition, however, that in any locality in which eighty-five percent (85%) of the members of any such designated trade shall propose to agree with me to abide by any local code of fair trade practices suggested by them for that locality, after approval of such local code by the Administrator, no member of such trade in such locality shall be entitled to display such NRA insignia, unless, in addition to the provisions of the said standards of labor, he is complying with all terms of such local code.

The Administrator may supplement this Order by such rules, regulations, exceptions, modifications, conditions and determinations as, in his opinion, shall effectuate the purposes of this Order and of said Act.
