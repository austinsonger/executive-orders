And it is hereby ordered, pursuant to Public Resolution 85, approved June 12, 1930 (ch. 471, 46 Stat. 580), that, subject to valid rights and the provisions of existing withdrawals, the public lands in said township shall be opened only to entry under the homestead or desert-land laws by qualified ex-service men for whose service recognition is granted by said resolution, under the terms and conditions of said resolution and the regulations issued thereunder, for a period of 91 days beginning with the date of the filing of the plat of resurvey of said township, and thereafter to appropriation by the general public under any public-land law applicable thereto.
