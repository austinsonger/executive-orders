Whereas, the Federal Alcohol Control Administration has submitted for my approval, an Amendment to the Code of Fair Competition for the Distilled Spirits Industry, and has rendered its report and recommendations and findings thereon:
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States, pursuant to the authority vested in me by Title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933, and otherwise, do hereby find:
