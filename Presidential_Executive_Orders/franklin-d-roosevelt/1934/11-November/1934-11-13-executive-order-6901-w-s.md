By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by the act of June 25, 1910 (ch. 421, 36 Stat. 847), as amended by the act of August 24, 1912 (ch. 369, 37 Stat. 497), and subject to the conditions therein expressed and to valid existing rights, it is hereby ordered that the tract of public land in Alaska lying within the following-described boundaries and indicated upon the diagram hereto annexed and forming a part hereof be, and the same is hereby, reserved and set apart for the joint use and occupancy of the Department of Agriculture and the Alaska Game Commission as a headquarters site in connection with the administration of Alaska game laws:
Beginning at corner no. 1, not monumented, about 280 ft. northeasterly of Poltes Slough of Yukon River, in the town site of Marshall, in approximate latitude 61°53'12" N. and longitude 162°06'14" W., from which the northwest corner of Marsh Hotel bears S. 32° E., 138 ft. distant; the U.
