## Executive Order 6838

By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1753 of the Revised Statutes (5 U.S.C., sec. 631), and by the Civil Service Act of January 16, 1883 (ch. 27, 22 Stat. 403, 404), and in view of the existing emergency with regard to the immediate taking of the agricultural census, it is hereby ordered that the Civil Service Commission may set up procedure and promulgate regulations under which persons who have passed civil-service examination and who have served temporarily or probationally for 6 months or more, with good records, in the Bureau of the Census, may have their names entered on a special reemployment list for temporary employments only in the Bureau of the Census in connection with the pending agricultural census. This special reemployment list shall be given priority over other registers of eligibles when so requested by the Secretary of Commerce.
