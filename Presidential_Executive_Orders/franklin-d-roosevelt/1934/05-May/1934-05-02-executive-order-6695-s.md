## Executive Order 6695

PAYMENT OF BURIAL EXPENSES OF DECEASED WAR VETERANS
By virtue of the authority vested in me under section 17 of title I of the act entitled "An Act To maintain the credit of the United States Government", approved March 20, 1933 (Public, No. 2, 73d Cong.), the following regulation amending Veterans' Regulation No. 9(b) is hereby prescribed:
1. Paragraph II of Veterans' Regulation No. 9(b) is amended to read as follows:
"II. Where an honorably discharged veteran of any war or a veteran of any war in receipt of pension or compensation dies after discharge, the Administrator, in his discretion and with due regard to the circumstances in each case, shall pay, for burial and funeral expenses and transportation of the body (inchiding preparation of the body) to the place of burial, a sum not exceeding $100 to cover such items and to be paid to such person or persons as may be prescribed by the Administrator. Burial allowance, or any part thereof, authorized under this regulation, shall not be payable if the veteran's net assets at the time of death, exclusive of debts and accrued pension, compensation, or insurance due at time of death, equal or exceed the sum of $1,000. The Administrator may, in his discretion, make contracts for burial and funeral sendees within the limits of the amount herein allowed without regard to the laws prescribing advertisement for proposals for supplies and services for the Veterans' Administration. No deduction shall be made from the sum allowed because of any contribution toward the burial and funeral (including transportation) which shall be made by a State, county, or other political subdivision, lodge, union, fraternal organization, society or beneficial organization, insurance company, Workmen's Compensation Commission, State Industrial Accident Board, or employer, but the aggregate of the sums allowed from all sources shall not exceed the actual cost of the burial and funeral (including transportation)."
