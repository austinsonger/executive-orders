Whereas it appears that the interests of economy require that certain transfers, consolidations, and eliminations provided for under section 4 of Executive Order No. 6166, of June 10, 1933, as amended, be further delayed beyond the effective date of said order;
Now, Therefore, pursuant to the provisions of section 22 of the said order, I hereby order that, except as hereinafter provided, the transfers, consolidations, and eliminations contemplated by section 4 of Executive Order No. 6166, of June 10, 1933, as amended, which are not effected prior to December 31, 1934, pursuant to Executive Order No. 6224, of July 27, 1933, Executive Order No. 6540, of December 28, 1933, and Executive Order No. 6727, of May 29, 1934, together with the operation of all other provisions of Executive Order No. 6166, of June 10, 1933, as amended, insofar as they relate to said section 4, be further delayed until June 30, 1935: Provided, That any transfer, consolidation, or elimination, in whole or in part, under said section 4, including any other provisions of the said order of June 10, 1933, insofar as they relate to section 4 thereof, may be made operative and effective between December 31, 1934, and June 30, 1935, by order of the Secretary of the Treasury, approved by the President.
