Whereas the widening and deepening of the entrance channel to the harbor of Honolulu and the enlargement of the harbor basin are essential to the safe and convenient navigation of said harbor; and
Whereas the plan and project of widening and deepening said channel and the enlargement of said harbor were approved August 31, 1933, by the Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works pursuant to authority contained in the act of Congress approved June 16, 1933 (ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, 201), entitled "An Act to encourage national industrial recovery, to foster fair competition, and to provide for the construction of certain useful public works, and for other purposes"; and
