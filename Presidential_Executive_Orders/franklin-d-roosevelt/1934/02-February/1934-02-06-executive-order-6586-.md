## Executive Order 6586

Whereas section 18 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, provides:
"The following functions are abolished in part:
"Cooperative vocational education and rehabilitation, 25 percent thereof.      "Payments for agricultural experiment stations, 25 percent thereof.      "Cooperative agricultural extension work, 25 percent thereof.      "Endowment and maintenance of colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts, 25 percent thereof."
Whereas the effective date of section 18 of Executive Order No. 6166 has been further deferred to April 10, 1934, by Executive Order No. 6585 of February 6, 1934; and
Whereas after further investigation, I have determined that the provisions of section 18 of Executive Order No. 6166 are not in the public interest or consistent with the efficient operation of the Government:
Now, Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 16 of the act of March 3, 1933 (ch. 212, 47 Stat. 1489, 1517), as amended by the act of March 20, 1933 (ch. 3, 48 Stat. 8, 16), section 18 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, is hereby revoked.
