## Executive Order 11378

WHEREAS Daniel J. Quill, Postmaster at San Antonio, Texas will, during the month of October 1967, become subject to compulsory retirement for age under the provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Law, unless exempted therefrom; and
WHEREAS, in my judgment, the public interest requires that Mr. Quill be exempted from such compulsory retirement:
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by Title V, 80 Stat. 571 (5 U.S.C. 8335), I hereby exempt Daniel J. Quill from compulsory retirement for age for a period of three years.

Except as the authority vested in the President by Title V of the law, is specifically exercised in this Order, nothing contained in this Order shall be deemed to limit or restrict in any manner the exercise of such authority delegated to the Civil Service Commission by Section 2 (c) of Executive Order No. 10530 of May 10, 1954, as amended by Executive Order No. 10682 of October 22, 1956.
