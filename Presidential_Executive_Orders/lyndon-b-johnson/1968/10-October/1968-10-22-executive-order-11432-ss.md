By virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended (22 U.S.C. 1934), and Section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Section 301 of Executive Order No. 10973 of November 3, 1961, is hereby amended to read as follows:
"Sec. 301. Department of the Treasury. There are hereby delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury:
"(a) The function conferred upon the President by the second sentence of Section 612 of the Act.
"(b) So much of the functions conferred upon the President by Section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, as relate to control of the import of arms, ammunition and implements of war, including technical data relating thereto. In carrying out such functions the Secretary of the Treasury shall consult with appropriate agencies, and on matters affecting world peace, the external security and foreign policy of the United States he shall be guided by the views of the Secretary of State. Designations, including changes in designations, of articles subject to import control under Section 414 shall have the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense." SEC. 2. All regulations issued and presently in effect pursuant to Section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, shall, insofar as they relate to control of the import of arms, ammunition and implements of war, including technical data relating thereto, continue in effect and be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury until revoked or superseded by him. All pending applications for import licenses not acted upon by the Secretary of State at the date of this order shall be transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury for appropriate action.
