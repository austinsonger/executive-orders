## Executive Order 11139

By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States and as Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States, I hereby authorize the Secretary of Defense, with respect to members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and the Secretary of the Treasury, with respect to members of the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, to prescribe regulations under which the United Nations Medal and Service Ribbon may be accepted by members of the armed forces who have been determined eligible for consideration in accordance with the Regulations for the United Nations Medal, promulgated by the United Nations Organization on July 30, 1959. A determination that service with the United Nations in a particular geographic area or for a particular purpose constitutes a justifiable basis for authorizing acceptance of the United Nations Medal and Service Ribbon by eligible members of the armed forces of the United States shall be made with the concurrence of the Secretary of State.
