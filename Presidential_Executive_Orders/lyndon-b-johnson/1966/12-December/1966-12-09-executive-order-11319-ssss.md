## Executive Order 11319

By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, and upon the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury, Executive Order No. 10707 of May 6, 1957, is amended by substituting for the second paragraph of the order the following:
On a white disk the shield of the Coat of Arms of the United States (paly of thirteen pieces argent and gules a chief azure) between the motto "SEMPER PARATUS" in red; circumscribed by a white annulet edged and inscribed "UNITED STATES COAST GUARD 1790" in blue all in front of two crossed anchors with stock, arms, and flukes in slight perspective in gold; superimposed upon a light blue disk with gold rope rim.
