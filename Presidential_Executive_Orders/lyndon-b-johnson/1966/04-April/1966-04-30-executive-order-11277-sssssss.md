By virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669; 22 U.S.C. 288), I hereby designate the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium, an organization in which the United States participates pursuant to the authority of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 (76 Stat. 419; 47 U.S.C. 701-744) and which was established pursuant to the Agreement Establishing Interim Arrangements for a Global Commercial Communications System of August 20, 1964, TIAS 5646, and the Special Agreement signed pursuant thereto, as an international organization, as that term is defined in Section 4 (i) of the International Organizations Immunities Act, entitled to enjoy, from and after August 20, 1964, all of the privileges, exemptions, and immunities provided by Section 4(a) of that Act.

The foregoing designation is not intended to abridge in any respect any privileges, exemptions, or immunities which such organization or the Interim Communications Satellite Committee (provided for by the above-mentioned Agreements) may have acquired or may hereafter acquire by treaty, Congressional action, or other Executive order.
