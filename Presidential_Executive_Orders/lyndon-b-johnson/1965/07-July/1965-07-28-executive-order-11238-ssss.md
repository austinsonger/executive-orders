SECTION 1. There Is hereby established a new "National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems." That Council shall have the same membership, functions, and status as the Council of the same name established by Section 4 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act (59 Stat. 512; 22 U.S.C. 286b) had immediately prior to the taking effect of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1965.

SEC. 2. This Order shall be effective as of July 27, 1965, and, together with the Council established by Section 1, shall terminate on January 1, 1966, or on such earlier date as may hereafter be prescribed.
