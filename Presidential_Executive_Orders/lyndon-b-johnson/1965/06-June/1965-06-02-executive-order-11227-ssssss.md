## Executive Order 11227

By virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669; 22 U.S.C. 288), and having found that the United States participates in the Interim Communications Satellite Committee pursuant to the authority of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 (76 Stat. 419; 47 U.S.C. 701-744) and the Agreement Establishing Interim Arrangements for a Global Commercial Communications System, August 20, 1964, TIAS 5646, I hereby designate the Interim Communications Satellite Committee as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the International Organizations Immunities Act, with the following exceptions:
1. The Interim Committee shall not enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred pursuant to Sections 2(b), 2(c), and 6 of that Act.
2. The officers and employees of the Interim Committee shall not enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred pursuant to Section 7(b) of that Act, but representatives to the Interim Committee and their alternates shall enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred pursuant to said Section 7(b).

The designation of the Interim Communications Satellite Committee as a public international organization within the meaning of the International Organizations Immunities Act is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions, or immunities which such organization may have acquired or may acquire by treaty or Congressional action.
