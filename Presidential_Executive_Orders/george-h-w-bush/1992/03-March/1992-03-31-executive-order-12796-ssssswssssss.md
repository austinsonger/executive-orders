## Executive Order 12796

Disputes exist between the National Railroad Passenger Corporation and its employees represented by certain labor organizations as designated on the attached list, which is made a part of this order.

These disputes have not been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended -188) ("The Act").

### Section 1. Creation of Emergency Board Thered is created, effective April 3, 1992, a board of five members to be appointed by the President to investigate the disputes. No member shall be pecuniarlily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any railroad carrier. The board shall perform its functions subject to the availability of funds.

### Section 2. Report The board shall report to the President on May 3, 1992, with respect to these disputes.

### Section 3. Maintaining Conditions As provided by section 10 of the Act, from the date of the creation of the board and for 30 days after the board has submitted its final report to the President, no change in the conditions out of which the disputes arose shall be made by the railroads or the employees, except by agreement of these parties.

### Section 4. Expiration The board shall terminate upon the submission of the report provided for in section 2 of this order.
