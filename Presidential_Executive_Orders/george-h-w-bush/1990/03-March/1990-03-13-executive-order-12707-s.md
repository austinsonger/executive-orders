## Executive Order 12707

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act et seq.), the National Emergencies Act et seq.), chapter 12 of title 50 of the United States Code et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code,
I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that the February 25, 1990, democratic election in Nicaragua has ended the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States previously posed by the policies and actions of the Sandinista government in that country, and the need to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12513 of May 1, 1985, to deal with that threat.

I hereby revoke Executive Order No. 12513 and terminate the national emergency declared in that order with respect to Nicaragua.

Pursuant to section 202 of the National Emergencies Act termination of the national emergency with respect to Nicaragua shall not affect any action or proceeding pending and not finally concluded or determined at the effective date of this order, or any action or proceeding based on any act committed prior to the effective date of this order, or any rights or duties that matured or penalties that were incurred prior to the effective date of this order.

This order shall take effect immediately.

George Bush
The White House,
March 13, 1990.
