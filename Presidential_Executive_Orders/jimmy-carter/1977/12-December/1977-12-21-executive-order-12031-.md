## Executive Order 12031

EXEMPTION OF JEROME M. KUYKENDALL FROM MANDATORY RETIREMENT
Jerome K. Kuykendall, Chairman, Indian Claims Commission, will become subject to mandatory retirement for age on December 31, 1977, under the provisions of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code unless exempted by Executive order.

In my judgment, the public interest requires that Jerome K. Kuykendall be exempted from such mandatory retirement.

Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt Jerome K. Kuykendall from mandatory retirement until September 30, 1978.
