## Executive Order 12006

EXEMPTION OF G. JOSEPH MINETTI FROM
MANDATORY RETIREMENT
G. Joseph Minetti, Member, Civil Aeronautics Board, will become subject to mandatory retirement for age on July 31, 1977, under the provisions of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code unless exempted by Executive order.

In my judgment, the public interest requires that G. Joseph Minetti be exempted from such mandatory retirement.

Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt G. Joseph Minetti from mandatory retirement until September 30, 1977.
