## Executive Order 12077

EXEMPTION OF ROY T. SESSUMS FROM MANDATORY RETIREMENT
Roy T. Sessums, Member, Mississippi River Commission, will become subject to mandatory retirement for age on August 31, 1978, under the provisions of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code unless exempted by Executive order.

In my judgment, the public interest requires that Roy T. Sessums be exempted from such mandatory retirement.

Now, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt Roy T. Sessums from mandatory retirement until October 1, 1978.
