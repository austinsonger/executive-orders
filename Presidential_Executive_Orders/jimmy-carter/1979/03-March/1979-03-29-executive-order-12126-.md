## Executive Order 12126

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution of the United States of America, and in order to delete an erroneous reference to a revoked Executive order in Executive Order No. 12107 of December 28, 1978, relating to the Civil Service Commission and Labor-Management in the Federal Service, the number "11512" is deleted from Section 2-101(b) of that Order.
