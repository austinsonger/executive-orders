## Executive Order 12159

CREATING AN EMERGENCY BOARD TO INVESTIGATE DISPUTES BETWEEN THE CHICAGO, ROCK ISLAND, PACIFIC RAILROAD & PEORIA TERMINAL COMPANY AND BROTHERHOOD OF RAILWAY, AIRLINE & STEAMSHIP CLERKS, FREIGHT HANDLERS, EXPRESS AND STATION EMPLOYEES; AND THE UNITED TRANSPORTATION UNION
Disputes exist between the Chicago, Rock Island, Pacific Railroad & Peoria Terminal Company and certain of its employees represented by both the Brotherhood of Railway, Airline & Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees; and the United Transportation Union.

These disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended; and
These disputes in the judgment of the National Mediation Board threaten substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive a section of the country of essential transportation service:
Now, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me by Section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 160), it is hereby ordered as follows:
1-101. Establishment of Board. There is established a board of three members to be appointed by the President to investigate these disputes. No member of the board shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any carrier.
1-102. Report. The board shall report its finding to the President with respect to these disputes within 30 days from the date of this Order.
1-103. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by Section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, from this date and for 30 days after the board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement, shall be made by the Chicago, Rock Island, Pacific Railroad & peoria Terminal Company, or by its employees, in the conditions out of which these disputes arose.
