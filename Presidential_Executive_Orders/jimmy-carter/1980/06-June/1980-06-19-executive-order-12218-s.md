### Authority

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and statutes of the United States of America, including Section 126b. (2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2155 (b) (2)), and having determined that withholding the exports proposed pursuant to Nuclear Regulatory Commission export license applications XSNM1379, XSNM-1569, XCOM-0240, XCOM-0250, XCOM-0376, XCOM0381 and XCOM-0395, would be seriously prejudicial to the achievement of United States non-proliferation objectives and would otherwise jeopardize the common defense and security, those exports to India are authorized; however, such exports shall not occur for a period of 60 days as defined by Section 130 g. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2159 (g)).
