By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701

) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601

I, JOSEPH R.

BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, in order to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024 of April 15, 2021 (Blocking Property With Respect To Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation), hereby order:
### Section 1. (a) With respect to any foreign person identified by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, in a report to the Congress pursuant to section 7503(a)(1)(B) of PEESA, all property and interests in property of such person that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in

(b) Sanctions under subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to any foreign person with respect to whom a waiver under section 7503(f) of PEESA has been issued.

(c) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order.
### Section 2.

The Secretary of State shall implement section 7503(b) of PEESA as it applies to visas, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement section 7503(b) of PEESA as it applies to admission and parole Such implementation shall be consistent with any exceptions or waivers provided by statute, or in regulations, orders, or directives that may be issued pursuant to this order.
### Section 3.

The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include:

(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and

(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person
### Section 4.

**purpose**

(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
### Section 5.

I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 US.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.
### Section 6.

**purpose**

### Section 7.

For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.
### Section 8.

**purpose**
 The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury.

All departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
### Section 9.

Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government or the United Nations, including its programs, funds, and other entities and bodies, as well as its specialized agencies and related organizations, by employees, grantees, and contractors thereof
### Section 10.

**authority**

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
