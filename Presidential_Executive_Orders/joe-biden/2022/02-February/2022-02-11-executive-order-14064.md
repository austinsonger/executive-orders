## Executive Order 14064

## Preamble

**Title 3—The President**  
**Executive Order 14064 of February 11, 2022**  
**Protecting Certain Property of Da Afghanistan Bank for the Benefit of the People of Afghanistan**

### Authority

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq.
) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 
et seq.
) (NEA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
I, JOSEPH R.

BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find that the widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan—including the urgent needs of the people of Afghanistan for food security, livelihoods support, water, sanitation, health, hygiene, shelter and settlement assistance, and COVID-19-related assistance, among other basic human needs—and the potential for a deepening economic collapse in Afghanistan constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.

I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.

In addition, I find that the preservation of certain property of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) held in the United States by United States financial institutions is of the utmost importance to addressing this national emergency and the welfare of the people of Afghanistan.

I also understand that various parties, including representatives of victims of terrorism, have asserted legal claims against certain property of DAB or indicated in public court filings an intent to make such claims.

This property is blocked under this order.

Accordingly, I hereby order:
### Section 1. (a) All property and interests in property of DAB that are held, as of the date of this order, in the United States by any United States financial institution, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in, except as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section

(b) United States financial institutions shall promptly transfer the blocked property described in subsection (a) of this section into a consolidated account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

(c) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order.
### Section 2.

**reg**
 This order and actions taken pursuant to this order shall supersede any previously issued Executive Order to the extent such order blocks, regulates, or otherwise affects the property and interests in property identified in section 1(a) of this order.
### Section 3.

**purpose**

(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
### Section 4.

**purpose**

### Section 5.

For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds and other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of the blocking of property and interests in property set forth in section 1(a) of this order.
### Section 6.

**purpose**
 The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury.

All executive departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.
### Section 7.

Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, and contractors thereof
### Section 8.

The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 US.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
### Section 9.

**authority**

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
