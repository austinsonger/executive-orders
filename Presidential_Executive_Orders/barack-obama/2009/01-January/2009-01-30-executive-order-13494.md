et seq
., it is hereby ordered that:
### Section 1.

To promote economy and efficiency in Government contracting, certain costs that are not directly related to the contractors' provision of goods and services to the Government shall be unallowable for payment, thereby directly reducing Government expenditures  This order is also consistent with the policy of the United States to remain impartial concerning any labor-management dispute involving Government contractors.

This order does not restrict the manner in which recipients of Federal funds may expend those funds.
### Section 2.

**policy**
  Such unallowable costs shall be excluded from any billing, claim, proposal, or disbursement applicable to any such Federal Government contract.
### Section 3.

Notwithstanding section 2 of this order, contracting departments and agencies shall treat as allowable costs incurred in maintaining satisfactory relations between the contractor and its employees, including costs of labor-management committees, employee publications (other than those undertaken to persuade employees to exercise or not to exercise, or concerning the manner of exercising, the right to organize and bargain collectively), and other related activities  See 48 C.F.R. 31.205-21.
### Section 4.

**purpose**

### Section 5.

**Reg**
  Such rules, regulations, and orders shall minimize the costs of compliance for contractors and shall not interfere with the ability of contractors to engage in advocacy through activities for which they do not claim reimbursement.
### Section 6.

Each contracting department or agency shall cooperate with the FAR Council and provide such information and assistance as the FAR Council may require in the performance of its functions under this order
### Section 7. (a)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations

(b) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
