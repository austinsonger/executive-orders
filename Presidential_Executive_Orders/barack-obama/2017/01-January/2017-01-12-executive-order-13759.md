Designation
### Authority

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288), and having found that the World Organisation for Animal Health (also known by its historical acronym OIE) is a public international organization in which the United States participates within the meaning of the International Organizations Immunities Act, I hereby designate the World Organisation for Animal Health as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities provided by the International Organizations Immunities Act.

This designation is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions, or immunities that such organization otherwise may have acquired or may acquire by law.
