WHEREAS the Chairman of the President's Council on Youth Fitness has caused to be made, and has recommended that I approve, a seal of office for the President's Council on Youth Fitness, the design of which accompanies and is hereby made a part of this order, and which is described as follows:
On a light blue disc edged gold, an open book with red binding, parchment color pages edged gold with suggested black lettering, the sinister section of the book surmounting a gold torch inflamed in natural colors all within an open wreath of green laurel leaves and in upper dexter a gold cloud issuing gold rays, all encircled by the inscription "President's Council on Youth Fitness July 16, 1956" in gold letters;
AND WHEREAS it appears that such seal is of suitable design and appropriate for establishment as the official seal of the President's Council on Youth Fitness:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, I hereby approve such seal as the official seal of the President's Council on Youth Fitness.
