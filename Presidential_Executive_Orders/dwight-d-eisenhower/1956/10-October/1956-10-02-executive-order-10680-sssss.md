## Executive Order 10680

By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act, approved December 29, 1945 (59 Stat. 669), and having found that the United States participates in the International Finance Corporation under the authority of the act of Congress approved August 11, 1955, (69 Stat. 669), I hereby designate the International Finance Corporation as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the said International Organizations Immunities Act.

The designation of the International Finance Corporation made by this order is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions, and immunities which such corporation may have acquired or may acquire by treaty or Congressional action; nor shall such designation be construed to affect in any way the applicability of the provisions of section 3, Article VI, of the Articles of Agreement of the Corporation deposited in the archives of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
THE WHITE HOUSE,
October 2, 1956.
