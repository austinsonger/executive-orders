## Executive Order 10652

By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Uniform Code of Military Justice (established by the Act of May 5, 1950, 64 Stat. 107), and as President of the United States, it is ordered that the second sentence of paragraph 126e of the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1951, (prescribed by Executive Order No. 10214 of February 8, 1951, as amended by Executive Order No. 10256 of June 23, 1951) be, and it is hereby, amended to read as follows:
"Unless otherwise prescribed in regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Department concerned, in the case of an enlisted person of other than the lowest pay grade, a court-martial sentence which, as approved by the convening authority, includes: (1) dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, whether or not suspended, (2) confinement, or (3) hard labor without confinement, immediately, upon being so approved, shall reduce such enlisted person to the lowest enlisted pay grade; provided, that the rate of pay of the person so reduced shall be commensurate with his cumulative service; and provided further, that any person so reduced shall have all rights, privileges, and property affected by such reduction restored if the sentence is subsequently set aside or disapproved, or if the sentence as finally approved does not contain any of the elements listed above."
This order shall become effective on January 20, 1956.
