By virtue of the authority vested in me by the act of September 2, 1958, 72 Stat. 1703, as amended, hereinafter called the act, and by the Public Buildings Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 479), and as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. The Department of Commerce is hereby designated as the department to perform all functions provided for in the act except those functions which the act either authorizes other agencies to perform or vests, in terms, in the President.

SEC. 2. Other interested departments and agencies of the Federal Government, including the Department of State and the National Science Foundation, are requested to cooperate as provided by section 4 of the act with the Department of Commerce in carrying out the provisions of the act.

SEC. 3. Any building constructed pursuant to the act shall become and shall be a "public building" under the Public Buildings Act of 1959 upon the close of the Exposition referred to in the act.

SEC. 4. This order supersedes the letter of the President to the Secretary of Commerce dated November 13, 1958, (23 F.R. 9169), but shall not affect Proclamation No. 3302 of July 10, 1959, entitled "World Science-Pan Pacific Exposition (Century 21 Exposition)."
