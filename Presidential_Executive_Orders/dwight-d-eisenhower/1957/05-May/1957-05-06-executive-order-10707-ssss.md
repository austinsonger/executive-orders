## Executive Order 10707

WHEREAS the Commandant of the United States Coast Guard with approval of the Secretary of the Treasury has caused to be made, and has recommended that I approve, a seal for the United States Coast Guard, the design of which accompanies and is hereby made a part of this order, and which is described in heraldic terms as follows:
On a white disk the shield of the Coat of Arms of the United States (paly of thirteen pieces argent and gules a chief azure) between the motto "SEMPER PARATUS" in red; circumscribed by a white annulet edged and inscribed "UNITED STATES COAST GUARD 1790" in blue all in front of two crossed anchors with stock, arms, and flukes in slight perspective in gold; superimposed upon a light blue disk with gold rope rim. The central device of the seal is the emblem of the United States Coast Guard.

AND WHEREAS it appears that such seal is of suitable design and appropriate for establishment as the official seal of the United States Coast Guard:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, I hereby approve such seal as the official seal of the United States Coast Guard.

DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
