By virtue of the authority vested in me by Title I of the Universal Military Training and Service Act (62 Stat. 604), as amended, I hereby prescribe the following amendments of the Selective Service Regulations prescribed by Executive Orders No. 10292 of September 25, 1951, No. 10363 of June 17, 1952, and No. 10420 of December 17, 1952, and constituting a portion of Chapter XVI of Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations:
1. Paragraph (a) of § 1622.30 of Part 1622, Classification Rules and Principles, is amended to read as follows:

(a) In Class III-A shall be placed any registrant who prior to August 25, 1953, has submitted evidence to the local board which establishes to the satisfaction of the local board that he has a child or children with whom he maintains a bona fide family relationship in their home. Such a registrant shall remain eligible for Class III-A so long as he maintains a bona fide family relationship with such child or children in their home.
2. Subparagraph (2) of paragraph (c) of § 1622.30 is amended to read as follows:
    (2) No registrant shall be placed In Class III-A under paragraph (a) of this section because he has a child which is not yet born unless prior to August 25, 1953, and prior to the time the local board mails him an order to report for Induction which is not subsequently cancelled for a reason not related to the filing of the certificate hereinafter mentioned, there is filed with the local board the certificate of a licensed physician stating that the child has been conceived, the probable date of its delivery, and the evidence upon which his positive diagnosis of pregnancy is based.
