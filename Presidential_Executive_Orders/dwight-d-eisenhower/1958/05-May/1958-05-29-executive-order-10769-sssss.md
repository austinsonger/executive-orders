## Executive Order 10769

By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act, approved December 29, 1945 (59 Stat. 669), and having found that the United States participates in the International Hydrographic Bureau under the authority of an act of Congress approved March 2, 1921 (41 Stat. 1215), I hereby designate the International Hydrographic Bureau as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the International Organizations Immunities Act.

The designation of the International Hydrographic Bureau as a public international organization within the meaning of the International Organizations Immunities Act shall not be deemed to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions, and immunities which such organization may have acquired or may acquire by treaty or congressional action.

DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
THE WHITE HOUSE,
May 29, 1958.
