## Executive Order 10535

By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Civil Service Act (22 Stat. 404) and by section 1753 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
1. The Civil Service Commission may confer a competitive status upon any employee or former employee of the Government who met the requirements for acquisition of such status under Executive Order No. 10080 of September 30, 1949, or under Executive Order No. 10157 of August 28, 1950, as amended, but was not recommended by an agency because of administrative error: Provided, that such employee is recommended by the agency in which he is employed, and such former employee is recommended either by an agency desiring to reemploy him or by the agency which could have recommended him under Executive Order No. 10080 or Executive Order No. 10157, as amended.
2. Acquisition of competitive status under this order shall not entitle any person to appeal a reduction in force or other personnel action made effective prior to the date on which the Civil Service Commission notifies the agency concerned that such person has been granted a competitive status under this order.
