## Executive Order 12563

A dispute exists between the Long Island Rail Road and certain of its employees represented by the labor organizations named on the list attached hereto and made a part hereof.

The dispute has not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (the "Act").

A party empowered by the Act has requested that the President establish a second emergency board pursuant to Section 9A(e) of the Act.

Section 9A(e) of the Act provides that the President, upon such a request, shall appoint an emergency board to investigate and report on the dispute.

Now, Therefore, by the authority vested in me by Section 9A(e) of the Act (45 U.S.C. § 159a(e)), it is hereby ordered as follows:
### Section 1. Establishment of Board There is hereby established a board of three members to be appointed by the President to investigate this dispute. No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any carrier. The board shall perform its functions subject to the availability of funds.

### Section 2. Report

(a) Within 30 days after creation of the board, the parties to the dispute shall submit to the board final offers for settlement of the dispute.
(b) Within 30 days after submission of final offers for settlement of the dispute, the board shall submit a report to the President setting forth its selection of the most reasonable offer.

### Section 3. Maintaining Conditions As provided by Section 9A(h) of the Act, from the time a request to establish a board is made until 60 days after the board makes its report, no change, except by agreement, shall be made by the parties in the conditions out of which the dispute arose.

### Section 4. Expiration The board shall terminate upon the submission of the report provided for in Section 2 of this Order.
