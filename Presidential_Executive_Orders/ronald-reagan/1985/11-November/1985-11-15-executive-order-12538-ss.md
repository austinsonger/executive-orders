## Executive Order 12538

### Authority

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including Section 504 of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 (Public Law 9983), and considering that the Libyan government actively pursues terrorism as an instrument of state policy and that Libya has developed significant capability to export petroleum products and thereby circumvent the prohibition imposed by Proclamation No. 4907 of March 10, 1982 and retained in Proclamation No. 5141 of December 22, 1983 on the importation of Libyan crude oil, it is ordered as follows:
### Section 1. (a) No petroleum product refined in Libya (except petroleum product loaded aboard maritime vessels at any time prior to two days after the  of this Executive Order) may be imported into the United States, its territories or possessions

**effective date**

(b) For the purposes of this Executive Order, the prohibition on importation of petroleum products refined in Libya shall apply to petroleum products which are currently classifiable under Item Numbers: 475.05; 475.10; 475.15; 475.25; 475.30; 475.35; 475.45; 475.65; 475.70 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202).
### Section 2. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue such rulings and instructions, or, following consultation with the Secretaries of State and Energy, such ulations as he deems necessary to implement this Order

**reg**
