By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C.

Section i is amended by deleting the word "twelve" and inserting in its place the word "thirteen" and by adding the following sentence at the end thereof:
"The members of the Committee other than the Chairman shall serve as representatives of labor and of management, and labor and management shall be equally represented among its members."
Section 4(b) is amended to read: "The Committee shall terminate on December 31, 1986, unless sooner extended."
