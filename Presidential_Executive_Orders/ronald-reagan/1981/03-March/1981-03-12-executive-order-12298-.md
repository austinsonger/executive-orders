## Executive Order 12298

### Authority

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution of the United States of America, and in order to eliminate unnecessary and duplicative Federal interference in the responsibilities of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (see Public Law 96-551 of December 19, 1980), it is hereby ordered that the Tahoe Federal Coordinating Council is terminated and Executive Order No. 12247 of October 15, 1980, is revoked.
