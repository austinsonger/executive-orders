## Executive Order 12405

Establishing an Emergency Board To Investigate a Dispute Between the Consolidated Rail Corporation and the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers
A dispute exists between the Consolidated Rail Corporation and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.

The dispute has not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended ("the Act").

This dispute, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, threatens substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive a section of the country of essential transportation service:
Now, Therefore, by the authority vested in me by Section 10 of the Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. § 160), it is hereby ordered as follows:
1-101. Establishment of Board. There is established, effective immediately, a board of three members to be appointed by the President to investigate this dispute. No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any carrier.
1-102. Report. The board shall report its findings to the President with respect to the dispute within 30 days of its creation.
1-103. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by Section 10 of the Act, as amended, from the date of the creation of the Emergency Board, and for 30 days after the board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement of the parties, shall be made by the carrier or by the employees, in the conditions out of which the dispute arose.
1-104. Expiration. The Emergency Board shall terminate upon submission of the report provided for in paragraph 1-102 of this Order.
