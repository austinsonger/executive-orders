## Executive Order 12437

### Authority

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and statutes of the United States of America, and in order to eliminate unnecessary administrative burdens and costs associated with the conversion of certain Federal powerplants to alternative sources of fuel, as required by the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (92 Stat. 3289), it is hereby ordered that Executive Order No. 12217 is revoked.
