## Executive Order 10094

WHEREAS Clyde B. Aitchison, a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, was by Executive Order No. 9780 of September 19, 1946, exempted from compulsory retirement for age for an indefinite period of time not extending beyond the duration of his appointment or term of office; and
WHEREAS his term of office will expire on December 31, 1949; and
WHEREAS sections 11 and 24 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, provide that upon the expiration of his term of office a Commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall continue to serve until his successor is appointed and shall have qualified; and
WHEREAS, in my judgment, the public interest requires that the said Clyde B. Aitchison be further exempted from compulsory retirement for age as provided below.

NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 204 of the act of June 30, 1932, 47 Stat. 404 (5 U.S.C. 715a), I hereby further exempt the said Clyde B. Aitchison from compulsory retirement for age until his successor in office is appointed and shall have qualified.
