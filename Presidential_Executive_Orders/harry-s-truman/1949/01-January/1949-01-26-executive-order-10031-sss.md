By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 215 of the Public Health Service Act, approved July 1, 1944 (58 Stat. 690), and as President of the United States, I hereby amend the regulations relating to commissioned officers and employees of the Public Health Service prescribed by Executive Order No. 9993 of August 31, 1948 (13 F.R. 5093), as portions of Chapter I, Title 42, Code of Federal Regulations:
1. The table of contents of the said regulations is amended by adding the following to Subpart H of Part 21: "21.155 Separation on grounds of disloyalty."
2. Subpart H of Part 21 of the said regulations is amended by adding thereto the following new section:
"§ 31.155 Separation on grounds of disloyalty. The loyalty to the Government of the United States of commissioned officers of the Service shall be subject to investigation, review, and determination in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order No. 9835 of March 21, 1947, entitled 'Prescribing Procedures for the Administration of an Employees Loyalty Program in the Executive Branch of the Government.' If the Administrator finds, in accordance with the standards and procedures prescribed by, or adopted pursuant to, the said Executive Order No. 9835 (including those relating to the right of appeal to the Loyalty Review Board for an advisory recommendation), that reasonable grounds exist for a belief that an officer of the Service is disloyal to the Government of the United States, such officer shall be separated from the Service.
