## Executive Order 9717

WHEREAS disputes exist between the Railway Express Agency, Inc., a carrier, and certain of its employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and the International Brotherhood of Blacksmiths, Drop Forgers and Helpers; and
WHEREAS these disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended; and
WHEREAS these disputes, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, threaten substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive a large section of the country of essential transportation service:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 160), the board created by Executive Order 9716 of April 24, 1946, to investigate the dispute between the Railway Express Agency, Inc., and certain of its employees represented by the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employes, a labor organization, is hereby further directed to investigate and to include in its report to the President its findings with respect to the disputes which also exist between the Railway Express Agency, Inc., and certain of its employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and the International Brotherhood of Blacksmiths, Drop Forgers and Helpers.

As provided by section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, from April 24, 1946 and for thirty days after the board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement, shall be made by the Railway Express Agency, Inc., or the said employees in the conditions out of which the said disputes arose.
