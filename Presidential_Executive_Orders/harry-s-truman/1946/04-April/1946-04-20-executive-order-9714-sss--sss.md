## Executive Order 9714

By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States and as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
Executive Order No. 9492 of October 24, 1944, as amended by Executive Order No. 9692 of September 24, 1945, prescribing regulations governing non-military and non-naval transportation on Army and Navy air transports, is hereby further amended (1) by substituting the words "two years" for the words "eighteen months" occurring in section 2 (c) thereof, and (2) by adding section 3, as follows:
"3. In cases in which aircraft of the War Department or of the Navy Department are flown by Army or Navy personnel on special missions for the exclusive use of other Federal agencies on official Government business connected with the activities of such agencies, payment therefore shall be on the basis of actual cost, instead of as provided in paragraph 2 (b) of this order."
