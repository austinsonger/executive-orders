## Executive Order 9761

By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1555 of the Revised Statutes of the United State (5 U.S.C. 418), the Secretary of the Navy is hereby directed to cause all flags, standards, and colors heretofore or hereafter taken by the Navy from the enemies of the United States in war to be deposited, for preservation and display, in the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, under the care of the Superintendent thereof: Provided, that any such flags, standards or colors taken by the Coast Guard of the United States, while, operating as a part of the Navy pursuant to law or direction of the President shall be deposited, for preservation and display, in the United States Coast Guard Academy at New London, Connecticut, under the care of the Superintendent thereof.

The order of President James K. Polk dated February 9, 1849, relating to the preservation and display of flags, standards, and colors taken by the Navy of the United States from their enemies in time of war, is hereby superseded.
