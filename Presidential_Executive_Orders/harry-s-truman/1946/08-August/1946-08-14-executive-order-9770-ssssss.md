## Executive Order 9770

WHEREAS under the regulations now in force the appointment of postmasters of the fourth class may be made without regard to the competitive provisions of the Civil Service Rules in any case in which the compensation of the office is not in excess of $500 per annum; and
WHEREAS it is deemed desirable and in the public interest that the said limitation of the $500 be raised to $1,000:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority invested in me by section 2 of the Civil Service Act (22 Stat. 403) and section 1753 of the Revised Statutes (5 U.S.C. 631), and for the purpose of carrying out the objective aforesaid, the regulations prescribed or approved by the President governing the appointment of postmasters of the fourth class are hereby amended by substituting "$1,000" for "$500" wherever the latter sum appears in the regulation.
