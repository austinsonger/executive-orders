## Executive Order 9698

The Food and Agriculture Organization.

The International Labor Organization.

The Pan American Union.

The United Nations.

The United National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

With respect to the designation of such other international organizations as may be entitled to the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the said Act, the Department of State is hereby designated as the agency to receive applications for the granting of such privileges, exemptions, and immunities. The Secretary of State shall require such information as he may deem necessary from the international organizations making such applications, and shall submit recommendations to the President as to whether the applicant organizations should be designated as public international organizations entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the said Act.
