## Executive Order 10014

By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, and pursuant to the policy expressed in section 1 of the Water Pollution Control Act approved June 30, 1948 (Public Law 845, 80th Congress), of recognizing, preserving, and protecting the primary responsibilities and rights of the States in controlling water pollution, I hereby direct the heads of the departments, agencies, and independent establishments of the executive branch of the Government to take such action as may be practicable, in cooperation with State and local authorities concerned with control of water pollution, to insure the disposal of sewage, garbage, refuse, and other wastes accumulated in the course or as a result of Federal activities, and industrial or manufactured foodstuffs and other products destroyed by order or under the supervision of Federal regulatory authorities, in such manner as will conform with programs formulated under State law and applicable to State agencies and the public generally for the preservation and improvement of the quality of surface and underground waters.
