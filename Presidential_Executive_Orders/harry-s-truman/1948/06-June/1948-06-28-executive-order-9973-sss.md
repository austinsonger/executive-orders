## Executive Order 9973

By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1753 of the Revised Statutes (5 U.S.C. 631) and by the Civil Service Act of January 16, 1883 (212 Stat. 403), it is ordered, in the interest of the internal management of the Government, that subdivision (f) of section 6.1 of Executive Order No. 9830 of February 24, 1947, amending the civil Service Rules and providing for Federal personnel administration, be, and it is hereby, amended to read as follows:

(f) Whenever any position in Schedule A or B (§ 6.4) or any position excepted from the competitive service by statute is occupied by a person having a competitive status, such person shall not be entitled to the protection against separation provided by this order and the Civil Service Rules and Regulations: Provided, That the Commission shall designate such positions in Schedules A and B as are not of a primarily confidential or policy-determining character and whenever any position so designated is occupied by a person having a competitive status, however he may have been appointed to such position, he shall be separated therefrom only in accordance with the provisions of this order and the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.
