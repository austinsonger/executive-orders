WHEREAS William E. Lee, a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, will, during the month of January 1952, become subject to compulsory retirement for age under the provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act of May 29, 1930 as amended, unless exempted therefrom by Executive order; and

NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 204 of the act of June 30, 1932, 47 Stat. 404 (5 U.SC. 715a), I hereby exempt the said William E. Lee from compulsory retirement for age for an indefinite period of time not extending beyond the expiration of his present term of office as a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission: Provided, that, for the purposes of this order, his present term of office shall be considered as expiring upon the appointment and qualification of his successor.
