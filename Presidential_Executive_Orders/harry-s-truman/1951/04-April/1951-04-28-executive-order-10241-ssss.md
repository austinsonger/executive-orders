By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, including the Civil Service Act of 1883 (22 Stat. 403) as amended, and section 9A of the act approved August 2, 1939 (5 U.S.C. 118j), and as President of the United States, it is ordered that paragraph 1 of Part V of Executive Order No. 9835 of March 21, 1947, entitled "Prescribing Procedures for the Administration of an Employees Loyalty Program in the Executive Branch of the Government", be, and it is hereby, amended to read as follows:
"1. The standard for the refusal of employment or the removal from employment in an executive department or agency on grounds relating to loyalty shall be that, on all the evidence, there is a reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the person involved to the Government of the United States."
