## Executive Order 10424

By virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 2 of the Civil Service Act (22 Stat. 404) and by Section 1753 of the Revised Statutes of the United State, I hereby authorize competitive Civil Service status for Norman E. Prince, presently an employee of the Department of the Navy, in order to correct an administrative error of the Veterans Administration made while he was an employee of that agency. Such status shall be accorded without compliance with the competitive provisions of the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.

This order is recommended by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs.
