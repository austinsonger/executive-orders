The Secretary of state shall make appropriate provision, effective September 1, 1952, for the taking of possession by the Department of State of any remaining records and property of the Commission and for the designation of officials of the Department of State who shall certify any vouchers which are payable from funds of the Commission and which may require certification after August 31, 1952.
