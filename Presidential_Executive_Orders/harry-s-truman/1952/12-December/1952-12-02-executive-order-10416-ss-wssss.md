By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1 of the act of August 1, 1892, 27 Stat. 340, as amended by the act of March 3, 1913, 37 Stat. 726 (40 U.S.C. 321), and as President of the United States, it is ordered that Executive Order No. 10251 of June 7, 1951, and Executive Order No. 10282 of August 29, 1951, suspending the eight-hour law with respect to laborers and mechanics employed by the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior, respectively, on public work essential to the national defense, be, and they are hereby, amended as follows:
The provisio in the penultimate paragraph of each of the said orders fixing the rate of pay for overtime thereunder is amended to read as follows:
"Provided, that the wages of all laborers and mechanics so employed shall be computed on a basic day rate of eight hours of work with overtime to be paid at a rate not less than time and one-half for all hours of work in excess of eight hour in any one day."
