## Executive Order 10337

WHEREAS under the regulations now in force the appointment of postmasters of the fourth class may be made upon the basis of investigation and report of a post office inspector in any case in which the compensation of the office is not in excess of $1300 per annum; and
WHEREAS it is deemed desirable and in the public interest that the said limitation of $1300 be raised to $1700:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Civil Service Act (22 Stat. 403) and section 1753 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (5 U.S.C. 631), and for the purpose of carrying out the objective aforesaid, the regulations prescribed or approved by the President governing the appointment of postmasters of the fourth class are hereby amended by substituting "$1700" for "$1300" wherever the latter sum appears in such regulations.

This order supersedes Executive Order No. 10017 of November 10, 1948, entitled "Amendment of the Regulations Governing the Appointment of Postmasters of the Fourth Class".

This order shall be effective as of July 1, 1951.
