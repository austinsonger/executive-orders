By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act, approved December 29, 1945 (59 Stat. 669), and having found that the United States participates in the following-named international organizations pursuant to a treaty or under the authority of an act of Congress authorizing such participation or making an appropriation therefor, I hereby designate such organizations as public international organizations entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the said Act:
1. United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization

The designation of the above-named organizations as public international organizations within the meaning of the said International Organizations Immunities Act is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges and immunities which such organizations may have acquired or may acquire by treaty or Congressional action.
