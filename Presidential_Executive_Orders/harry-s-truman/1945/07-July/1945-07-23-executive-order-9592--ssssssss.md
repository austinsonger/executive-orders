By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including section 9 of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, it is ordered that the last paragraph of Executive Order No. 9400 of December 3, 19443, authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to take possession of and operate the shipyard of the Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation at Los Angeles, California, be, and it is hereby, amended to read as follows:
"Possession and operation of the said shipyard under this order shall be terminated by the Secretary of the Navy when he determines that the shipyard will be operated privately in an efficient manner consistent with the requirements of the war effort."
