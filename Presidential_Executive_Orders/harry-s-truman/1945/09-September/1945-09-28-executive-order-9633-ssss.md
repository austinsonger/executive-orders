## Executive Order 9633

By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me as President of the United States, it is ordered that the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf beneath the high seas but contiguous to the coasts of the United States declared this day by proclamation to appertain to the United States and to be subject to its jurisdiction and control, be and they are hereby reserved, set aside, and placed under the jurisdiction and control of the Secretary of the Interior for administrative purposes, pending the enactment of legislation in regard thereto. Neither this Order nor the aforesaid proclamation shall be deemed to affect the determination by legislation or judicial decree of any issues between the United States and the several states, relating to the ownership or control of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf within or outside of the three-mile limit.
