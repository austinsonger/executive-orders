## Executive Order 9598

By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1753 of the Revised Statutes of the United States and by section 2 of the Civil Service Act (22 Stat. 403), it is hereby ordered as follows:
Hereafter no person shall be accorded as classified civil-service status on the basis of his name having been reached on a civil-service register unless he shall have been regularly selected for appointment from a certificate issued by the Civil Service Commission for probational appointment and shall have entered on duty pursuant to selection from such certificate, or unless (a) he shall have been appointed to a classified (competitive) position for other than temporaryless, (b) his appointment shall have been prior to March 16, 1942, with respect to positions generally or prior to October 23, 1943, with respect to positions in the field service of the Post Office Department, and (c) the records of the Civil Service Commission clearly show that he stood higher on an appropriate civil-service list of eligibles than another eligible who received an original probational appointment from such list.

This order supersedes Executive Order No. 9506 of December 12, 1944; but does not supersede or modify Executive Order No. 9538 of April 13, 1945.
