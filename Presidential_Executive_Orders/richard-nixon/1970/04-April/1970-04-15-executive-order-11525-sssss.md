## Executive Order 11525

By virtue of the authority vested in me by the laws of the United States, including the Act of December 16, 1967, 81 Stat. 649, the Federal Employees Salary Act of 1970, and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
SEC. 1. The rates of monthly basic pay for members of the uniformed services within each pay grade are adjusted upwards as set forth in the following tables:
SEC. 2. (a) A person who became entitled after December 31, 1969, but before the date of enactment of the Federal Employees Salary Act of 1970, to payment for items such as lump-sum leave, reenlistment and variable reenlistment bonus, continuation pay, any type of separation pay, or six months death gratuity, shall not be entitled to any increase in any such payment by virtue of this order.

(b) Authority to prescribe other rules for payment of retroactive compensation shall be exercised for the uniformed services by the Secretary of Defense. Entitlement to retroactive pay under such rules shall be subject to the provisions of section 5 of the Federal Employees Salary Act of 1970, and shall conform as nearly as may be practicable to the provisions of Section 7 of the Act of December 16, 1967, 81 Stat. 654.
SEC. 3. This order shall take effect January 1, 1970.
