## Executive Order 11535

By virtue of the authority vested in me by sections 55 (a) and 1604 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended (26 U.S.C. (1952 Ed.) 55(a), 1604(c)), and by sections 6103 (a) and 6106 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (26 U.S.C. 6103 (a), 6106), it is hereby ordered that any income, excess-profits, estate, gift, unemployment, or excise tax return, including all reports, documents, or other factual data relating thereto, shall, during the Ninety-first Congress, be open to inspection by the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, or any duly authorized subcommittee thereof, in connection with its consideration of House Resolution 920, a resolution impeaching William 0. Douglas, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Whenever a return is open to inspection by such Committee or subcommittee, a copy thereof shall, upon request, be furnished to such Committee or subcommittee. Such inspection shall be in accordance and upon compliance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury in Treasury Decisions 6132 and 6133, relating to the inspection of returns by committees of the Congress, approved by the President on May 3, 1955.
