## Executive Order 11757

Lawrence Quincy Mumford, Librarian of Congress, will, during December, 1973, become subject to mandatory retirement for age under the provisions of section 8335 of title 5 of the United States Code unless exempted therefrom by Executive order.

In my judgment, the public interest requires that Mr. Mumford be exempted from such mandatory requirement.

Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of section 8335 of title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt Lawrence Quincy Mumford from mandatory retirement until December 31, 1974.

RICHARD NIXON
The White House,
December 30, 1973.
