## Executive Order 11642

On November 16, 1970, I issued Executive Order No. 11568, exempting A. Everette Maclntyre, a member of the Federal Trade Commission, from compulsory retirement for age, under the provisions of section 8335 of title 5, United States Code, until February 29, 1972.

In my judgment, the public interest requires that Mr. Maclntyre be further exempted from such compulsory retirement:
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of section 8335 of title 5, United States Code, I hereby exempt A. Everette Maclntyre from compulsory retirement for age until February 28, 1973.
