## Executive Order 11657

C. Everett Spangler, a member of the Federal Farm Credit Board, reached the age of 70 on February 4, 1972. Under section 8335 of title 5, United States Code, he would be subject to compulsory retirement for age unless exempted therefrom by Executive order.

It is my judgment that the public interest requires that Mr. Spangler be exempted from such compulsory retirement:
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of section 8335 of title 5, United States Code, I hereby exempt C. Everett Spangler from compulsory retirement for age until April 1, 1974.

This order shall be effective March 1, 1972.

RICHARD NIXON
The White House,
March 22, 1972
