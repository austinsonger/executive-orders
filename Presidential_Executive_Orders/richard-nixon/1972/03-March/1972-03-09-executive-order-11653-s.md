## Executive Order 11653

Jack T. Stuart, United States Marshal for the Southern District of Mississippi reached the age of 70 on February 22, 1972. Under section 8335 of title 5, United States Code, he would be subject to compulsory retirement for age, after 60 days advance notice, unless exempted therefrom by Executive order.

It is my judgment that the public interest would be well served if Mr. Stuart were to be exempted from such compulsory retirement:
Now THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of section 8335 of title 5, United States Code, I hereby exempt Jack T. Stuart from compulsory retirement for age until May 19, 1975.

RICHARD NIXON
The White House,
