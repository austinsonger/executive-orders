## Executive Order 11595

By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, Executive Order No. 11583 of February 24, 1971, is amended by substituting for section 1 thereof the following:
"SECTION 1. Office of Consumer Affairs. The Office of Consumer Affairs (hereinafter referred to as the 'Office') is hereby established in the Executive Office of the President. The Office shall be headed by a Director, who shall be appointed by the President, and there shall be in the Office two Deputy Directors who shall also be appointed by the President. The Deputy Directors shall perform such duties as the Director may designate, and in case of a vacancy in the office of Director or during the absence or incapacity of the Director, the Deputy Directors, in the order designated by the President, shall act as Director. The Director and Deputy Directors shall receive compensation at such rates as the President, consonant with law, may hereafter determine."
