## Executive Order 11635

The Governors of the member States of the Souris-Red-Rainy River Basins Commission and the Water Resources Council have requested the continuation of the Commission beyond its present termination date. I have determined that it would be in the public interest to comply with that request and continue the joint Federal-State water and related land resources planning and coordination activities being carried out by the Commission.

Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 201 of the Water Resources Planning Act (42 U.S.C. 1962b), and as President of the United States, section 7 of Executive Order No. 11359 of June 20, 1967, is hereby amended to read as follows:
"SEC. 7. Termination. The Commission shall terminate on June 30, 1973, unless, upon recommendation of both the Council and not less than one-half the number of member States, this order is extended."
