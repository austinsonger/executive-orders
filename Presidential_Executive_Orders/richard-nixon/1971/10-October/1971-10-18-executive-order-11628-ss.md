## Executive Order 11628

The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has caused to be made, and has recommended that I approve, a seal for the Environmental Protection Agency, the design of which accompanies and is hereby made a part of this order, and which is described as follows:
A flower with a bloom which is symbolic of all the elements of the environment. The bloom is a sphere, the component parts of which represent the blue sky, green earth, blue-green water. A white circle within the sphere denotes either the sun or the moon. All are symbolic of a clean environment and are superimposed on a disc with a white background, circled by the title "UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY" in blue letters.

It appears that such seal is of suitable design and appropriate for adoption as the official seal of the Environmental Protection Agency:
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, I hereby approve such seal as the official seal of the Environmental Protection Agency.
