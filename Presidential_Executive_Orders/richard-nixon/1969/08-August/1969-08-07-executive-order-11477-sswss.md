## Executive Order 11477

By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
The Atomic Energy Commission is hereby designated and empowered, without approval, ratification, or other action by the President, to grant by the unanimous affirmative vote of all of its members not more than five awards in any calendar year, not exceeding the sum of $5,000 each, pursuant to the last sentence of section 157b (3) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2187 (b) (3)) which authorizes the Commission to grant awards for especially meritorious contributions to the development, use, or control of atomic energy.
