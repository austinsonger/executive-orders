## Executive Order 13827

## Preamble

**Title 3â€”The President**  
**Executive Order 13827 of March 19, 2018**  
**Taking Additional Steps to Address the Situation in Venezuela**

### Authority

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq.
) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 
et seq.
), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
I, DONALD J.

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, in order to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692 of March 8, 2015, and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13808 of August 24, 2017, and in light of recent actions taken by the Maduro regime to attempt to circumvent U.S. sanctions by issuing a digital currency in a process that Venezuela's democratically elected National Assembly has denounced as unlawful, hereby order as follows:
### Section 1.

**effective date**

(b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the effective date of this order.
### Section 2.

**purpose**

(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
### Section 3.

**purpose**
A. (PdVSA), and any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Venezuela.
### Section 4.

**reg**
 The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions to other officers and executive departments and agencies of the 
United States Government.

All agencies of the United States Government shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
### Section 5.

For those persons whose property and interests in property are affected by this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692, there need be no prior notice given for implementation of this order.
### Section 6.

This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person
### Section 7.

This order is effective at 12:15 pm. eastern daylight time on March 19, 2018.
