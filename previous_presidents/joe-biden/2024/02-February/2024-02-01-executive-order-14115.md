## Executive Order 14115

Executive Order 14115 of February 1, 2024
Imposing Certain Sanctions on Persons Undermining Peace, Security, and Stability in the West Bank
### Authority

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq.
) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 
et seq.
) (NEA), section 212(f) and section 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 8 U.S.C. 1185(a)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
I, JOSEPH R.

BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find that the situation in the West Bank—in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction—has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region.

These actions undermine the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution and ensuring Israelis and Palestinians can attain equal measures of security, prosperity, and freedom.

They also undermine the security of Israel and have the potential to lead to broader regional destabilization across the Middle East, threatening United States personnel and interests.

For these reasons, these actions constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.

I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.

Accordingly, I hereby order:
### Section 1.

**purpose**

### Section 2.

**reg**

### Section 3.

The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include:

(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and

(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person
### Section 4.

**enforcement**

(b) The Secretary of State shall implement this order as it applies to visas pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may establish.

(c) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this order as it applies to the entry of noncitizens pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may establish.

(d) Such persons shall be treated by this section in the same manner as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).
### Section 5.

**purpose**

(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
### Section 6.

I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 US.C. 1702(b)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to 
deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.
### Section 7.

**purpose**

### Section 8.

For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked or affected by this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds and other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to this order.
### Section 9.

**purpose**
 The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury.

All executive departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.
### Section 10.

Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government or the United Nations (including its specialized agencies, programs, funds, and related organizations) by employees, grantees, and contractors thereof
### Section 11.

The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 US.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
### Section 12.

**authority**

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
