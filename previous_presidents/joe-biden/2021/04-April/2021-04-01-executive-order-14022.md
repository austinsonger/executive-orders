## Executive Order 14022

Executive Order 14022 of April 1, 2021
Termination of Emergency With Respect to the International Criminal Court
### Authority

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq.
), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 
et seq.
) (NEA), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
I, JOSEPH R.

BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find that, although the United States continues to object to the International Criminal Court's (ICC) assertions of jurisdiction over personnel of such non-States Parties as the United States and its allies absent their consent or referral by the United Nations Security Council and will vigorously protect current and former United States personnel from any attempts to exercise such jurisdiction, the threat and imposition of financial sanctions against the Court, its personnel, and those who assist it are not an effective or appropriate strategy for addressing the United States' concerns with the ICC.

Accordingly, I hereby terminate the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13928 of June 11, 2020 (Blocking Property of Certain Persons Associated With the International Criminal Court), and revoke that order, and further order:
### Section 1.

**revocation**

### Section 2.

Pursuant to section 202(a) of the NEA (50 US.C. 1622(a)), termination of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13928 shall not affect any action taken or proceeding pending not finally concluded or determined as of the date of this order, any action or proceeding based on any act committed prior to the date of this order, or any rights or duties that matured or penalties that were incurred prior to the date of this order.
### Section 3.

**authority**

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

BIDEN.EPS
THE WHITE HOUSE,
April 1, 2021.
