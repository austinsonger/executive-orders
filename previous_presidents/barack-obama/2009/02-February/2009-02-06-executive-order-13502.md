## Executive Order 13502

Executive Order 13502 of February 6, 2009
Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects
### Authority

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act,  40 U.S.C. 101 
et seq.
, and in order to promote the efficient administration and completion of Federal construction projects,  it is hereby ordered that:
### Section 1.

**Policy**

(a) Large-scale construction projects pose special challenges to efficient and timely procurement by the Federal Government.

Construction employers typically do not have a permanent workforce, which makes it difficult for them to predict labor costs when bidding on contracts and to ensure a steady supply of labor on contracts being performed.

Challenges also arise due to the fact that construction projects typically involve multiple employers at a single location.

A labor dispute involving one employer can delay the entire project.

A lack of coordination among various employers, or uncertainty about the terms and conditions of employment of various groups of workers, can create frictions and disputes in the absence of  an agreed-upon resolution mechanism.

These problems threaten the efficient and timely completion of construction projects undertaken by Federal contractors.

On larger projects, which are generally more complex and of longer duration, these problems tend to be more pronounced.

(b) The use of a project labor agreement may prevent these problems from developing by providing structure and stability    to large-scale construction projects, thereby promoting the efficient and expeditious completion of Federal construction contracts.

Accordingly, it is the policy of the Federal Government to encourage executive agencies to consider    requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection    with large-scale construction projects in order to promote  economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.
### Section 2.

**Definitions**

(a) The term “labor organization” as used in this order means a labor organization as defined in 29 U.S.C. 152(5).

(b) The term “construction” as used in this order means construction, rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, extension, repair, or improvement of buildings, highways, or other real property.

(c) The term “large-scale construction project” as used in this order means a construction project where the total cost to the Federal Government is $25 million or more.

(d) The term “executive agency” as used in this order has the same meaning as in 5 U.S.C. 105, but excludes the Government Accountability Office.

(e) The term “project labor agreement” as used in this order means a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with     one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).
### Section 3.

**reg**

(b) If an executive agency determines under subsection (a) that the use of a project labor agreement will satisfy the criteria in clauses (i) and (ii) of that subsection, the agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor or subcontractor on the project agree, for that project, to  negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with   one or more appropriate labor organizations.
### Section 4.

**reg**

### Section 5.

This order does not require an executive agency to use a project labor agreement on any construction project, nor does it preclude the use of a project labor agreement in circumstances not covered by this order, including leasehold arrangements and projects receiving Federal financial    assistance  This order also does not require contractors or subcontractors to enter into a project labor agreement with any particular labor organization.
### Section 6.

**Reg**

### Section 7.

The Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and with other officials as appropriate, shall provide the President within 180 days of this order, recommendations about whether broader use of project labor agreements, with respect to both construction projects   undertaken under Federal contracts and construction projects receiving Federal financial assistance, would help to promote   the economical, efficient, and timely completion of such  projects
### Section 8.

**Reg**

Executive Order 13202 of February 17, 2001, and Executive Order 13208 of April 6, 2001, are revoked.

The heads  of executive agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, revoke expeditiously any orders, rules, or regulations implementing Executive Orders 13202 and 13208.
### Section 9.

Severability
If any provision of this order, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of the provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
### Section 10.

General

    (i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or
    (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create   any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
