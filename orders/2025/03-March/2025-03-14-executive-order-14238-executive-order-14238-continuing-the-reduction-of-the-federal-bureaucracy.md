(c) In reviewing budget requests submitted by the governmental entities listed in subsection (a) of this section, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget or the head of any executive department or agency charged with reviewing grant requests by such entities shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law and except insofar as necessary to effectuate an expected termination, reject funding requests for such governmental entities to the extent they are inconsistent with this order.

(a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
    (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
